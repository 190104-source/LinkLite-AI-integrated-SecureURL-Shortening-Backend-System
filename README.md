Project Overview:
<br>

Built a secure URL shortening service where users can register/login, generate short links, manage their own URLs, and get redirected to original links. Access is controlled using JWT-based authentication and authorization.

The system ensures only safe URLs are shortened, preventing users from accessing malicious links.
